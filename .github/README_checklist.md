🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Wearable Analytics Pipeline!

Built an end-to-end BigQuery analytics system for physiological data from wearables (think Myzone, Whoop, Oura).

Key achievements:
✅ 99% cost optimization ($50/mo → $0/mo)
✅ 100x query performance improvement
✅ Advanced features: HRV analysis, stress detection, exercise zones
✅ User segmentation with personalized recommendations

Tech: BigQuery, SQL, Python, 50M measurements
Skills: Data architecture, product analytics, cost optimization

This demonstrates my ability to:
- Design scalable data systems
- Extract actionable insights from complex data
- Optimize for cost and performance
- Think like a PM (not just engineer)

Perfect for PM roles at wearable tech companies! 💪
